# CS132: Compiler Construction

## Thursday September 22rd
###Two pass compiler:
1. front end: independent of architecture, specific to languages
2. back end: independent of language, specific to architectures

###Scanner's two functionalities:
1. get all the tokens
2. skip all the meaningless characters such as white spaces

### LL Parsing
Regular expression is bad at expressing brackets (including predefined keywords). Thus, we use context-free grammar for parsing.
#### Ambiguity
Two different interpretations
```
if E1 then
  if E2 then
    S1
  else S2
```
```
if E1 then
  if E2 then
    S1
else S2
```
#### Left-most Derivation and Right-most Derivation
Let-most Dervation will end up with Top-down parsing while reverse right-most derivation will end up with bottom-up parsing.
