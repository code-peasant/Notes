##Question
1. In Lecture 4 starting at Slide 26, how exactly do `firstprivate` and `lastprivate` work? Or in other words, how's the underlying
implementation guarantee that this shared variable will have the correct values for corresponding threads or iterations to load?
2. What is an `orphan pragma`?
