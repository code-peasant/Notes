##Monday April 4th
Continue on **First Class Functions**

###**Higher Order Function**
a function takes another function as input or output another function

**Example**: given a pair, add 1 to the first element 
```Ocaml
let incFirst = fun p ->
  match p with
  (x,y) -> (x+1,y);;
```

**concatenation**: using `^`
```oCaml
# "hello" ^ "!";;
-: string = "hello!"
```

**Example**: given a pair, add an "!" to the first element
```oCaml
let exclaimFirst = fun p ->
  match p with
    (x,y) -> (x^"!",y);;
```

Now, abstract this idea

**Example**:  
applyToFirst:  
  input: function, and a pair  
  output: apply the function to the first component
```oCaml
let applyToFirst = fun f p ->
  match p with
    (a,b) -> (f a, b);;
```

**Note**: add parentheses around an operator will make it a prefix function

####Using `map`
```Ocaml
map (map (fun x -> x + 1)) [[1;2;3];[4;5;6];[7;8;9]]
```

**Example**:  
removeNegatives: remove the negative ints from a list of ints.
```oCaml
let rec removeNegatives = fun l ->
  match l with
    [] -> []
  | h::t -> 
    let t' = removeNegatives t in
    if h < 0 then t' else h::t';;
```

**Example**:  
removeEmpty: remove the negative strings from a list of strings.

####Defining `filter`  
Take a predicate, and a list, return a new list containing the elements for which the predicate holds true.
```oCaml
let rec filter = fun f l->
  match l with
    [] -> []
  | h::t -> 
    let t' = filter f t in 
    if f h then h::t'
    else t';;
```
**Example**:  
combineIntsLeft, compute the result left-associatively
```oCaml
let combineIntsLeft = fun f l ->
match l with
[x] -> x
| h1::h2::t -> combineIntsLeft f (f h1 h2::t);;
```
##Wednesday April 6th
**Example**  
How can we make sumList, prodList work for empty lists?
```Ocaml
let rec combineInts = fun f l ifNil ->
match l with
  [] -> ifNil
| hd::tl -> f hd (combineInts f tl ifNil);;
```
Now use this combineInts to implement `length`
```Ocaml
let length l = combineInts(fun _ lengthOfTail -> 1 + lengthOfTail) l 0;;
```
In reality, this `combineInts` is called `reduce` or `fold`, `fold_right` and it is more powerful than `map` or `filter`

**Exercise**  
define `map` and `filter` using `fold_right`
```oCaml
let map f l = List.fold_right (fun hd map_f_tl -> f hd::map_f_tl) l [];;
```

###Data Types
User-defined data types give us a way to define our own abstractions. a type with associated operations and Ocaml supports all kinds of user-defined data types but with the properties of immuntibility and pattern matching.
```Ocaml
(* Enum in ocaml *)
type sign = Pos | Neg | Zero;;
(*
-defines a new type "sign"
-three values that have type "sign"

Note:
-type names must start with a lower case letter
-Pos/Neg/Zero are called constructors of sign
-constructor names must start with an upper case letter
*)

(* a type with some fields/data, like a struct in C *)
type point = Point of (float * float);;

(* Syntax: <constructor_name> of <type> *)
(* Note: point is not a value *)
(* the types "point" and (float * float) are two different types *)

type point2 = float * float;;
(* point2 is just a new name (abbreviation for (float * float) *)
(* like typedef in C *)

(* it is good that ocaml doesn't have null pointers/references *)

type nullableInt = Null | NonNull of int;;

(* combines the ideas of two previous examples:
-two ways of constructing a nullableInt
-we have associated data/fields.
*)

(* example: increment a nullableInt *)

let incNullableInt x = 
  match x with
    Null -> Null
    | NonNull i -> NonNUll (i + 1);;
    
(* can't reuse constructor names for multiple types *)

type 'a nullable = Null | NonNull of 'a;;

let updNullable f n = 
  match n with
    Null -> Null
  |  NonNull x -> NonNull (f x);;
  
(* nullable is widely used in functional programming, usually called by other names:
in ocaml, "nullable" is called option.
"Null" is called None.
"NonNull" is called Some.
*)

(* define a function get that returns the nth element of a list *)
let rec get (n: int) (l: 'a list) : 'a option = 
  match (n, l) with
    (0,h::_) -> Some
  | (_,_::t) -> get (n-1) t
  | (_,[]) -> None;;
```

##Monday April 11th
###Higher Order Function Review
a function that takes another function a an argument
```oCaml
(* List.fold_right *)
List.fold_right (fun s oldCount -> oldCount + String.length s) ["hello";"there";"goodbye"] 0;;

(* use fold_right to reverse a list *)
let reverse l = List.fold_right(fun elem reversedRest -> reversedRest@[elem]) l [];;

(* test if x is in the list l *)
let contains x l = List.fold_right(fun elem isInRestOfList -> isInRestOfList || elem = x) l false;;

let twoToN n = 
  match n with
    1 -> []
  | _ -> (twoToN (n-1)) @ [n];;
  
(* checks if n is prime *)
let isPrime n = 
  let l = twoToN (n-1) in
  List.fold_right
    (fun elem prime -> (n mod elem != 0) && prime) l true;;
  
(* return a list of all elements of l that are prime *)

```
###Datatypes Review
```Ocaml
(* tagged union:
  - union because it's an OR of several cases
  - tagged because each case has label/tag *)
type optInt = Null | Nonnull of int

(* only equality operator works for user-defined types *)

let addOptInt (oi1: optInt)  (oi2: optInt) = 
  match (oi1, oi2) with
    (Nonnull i1, Nonnull i2) -> Nonnull i1+i2
  | _ -> Null;;
  
type 'a option = None | Some of 'a

Some (Some "hi");;
- : string option option = Some (Some "hi")

(* examples for Null *)
(* return an input option with the index of the first occurrence of x in l *)
let find x l =
  let rec aux index l = 
    match l with
      [] -> None
    | h::t -> if h=x then Some index else aus (index+1) t
  in aux 0 1;;
  
(* recursive data types *)
(* a list *)
type mylist = Empty | Node of int * mylist;;

let rec sumList = 
function l with
  Empty -> 0
| Node(h,t) -> h + sumlist t;;

(* polymorphic list *)
type 'a mylist = Empty | Node of 'a * 'a mylist

(* binary trees *)
type btree = Leaf | Node of btree * btree * int

let rec treeSize t = 
  match t with
    Leaf -> 0
  | Node(left, right, d) -> 1 + treeSize left + treeSize right;;
```

##Wednesday April 13th
###Data Types
```oCaml
(* find the height of a tree *)
let rec height t = 
match t with
    Leaf -> 1
  | Node(l,_,r) -> 1 + (max (height l) (height r));;

(* insert into the binary tree *)  
let rec insert n t = 
match t with
  Leaf -> Node(Leaf, t, Leaft)
| Node(left, value, right) -> if n > value then Node(left, value, insert n right)
else Node(insert n left, value, right);;
```
###Variable Scoping
* top-level let  
  let x = 5;  
  **scope**: the rest of the program  
* let expression  
  let x = 5 in x+2  
  let x = e1 in e2  
  **scope**: e2  
* pattern matching  
* function parameters  

**static scoping** or **lexical scoping**:  
at compile time, you can determine, for each variable usage, which variable declaration it refers to.

**Key point**: a variable's lifetime is different from its scope: a variable can be live, because other code refers to it, even if it's out of scope.

##Wednesday April 20th
###Parametric Polymorphism
```oCaml
let maybeSwap (x,y) b =
if b
then (y,x)
else (x,y)

(* in this case, x and y must have the same type because in ordr to use a single type to include the results, (x,y) and (y,x) must have the same type. *)

(* Don't confuse parametric polymorphism with static overloading

static overloading: many different pieces of code, all with the same name, one per type that you care about
parametric polymorphism: 1 piece of code, which can be safely passed arguments of many different types*)
```
###Module in OCaml
Motivation: need a way to separate interface from implementation. (let me upgrade my internal implementation without breaking callers)

```oCaml
module Set = struct
...
end
```
member function is not visible at top level, but visible in the scope of the module.

```oCaml
(* signature *)
module type SET = sig
  type t
  val emptyset: t
  val member: int -> t -> bool
  val add: int -> t -> t
  val union: t -> t -> t
end

module Set: SET = struct
type t = int list
```
Polymorphic Version:
```oCaml
(* signature *)
module type SET = sig
  type 'a t
  val emptyset: 'a t
  val member: 'a -> 'a t -> bool
  val add: 'a -> 'a t -> 'a t
  val union: 'a t -> 'a t -> 'a t
end

module Set: SET = struct
type t = 'a list
```

##Monday April 25th
```oCaml
(* Tail Recursion *)
let rec fact n = 
  match n with
  0 -> 1
  | _ -> n * fact(n-1)
  
(* tail recursion version *)
let fact n = 
  let rec helper n res = 
  match n with
  0 -> res
  | _ -> helper (n-1) (res*n)
  in helper n 1
  
  (* tail call optimization *)
  a tail call is a function call that is the last operation done dynamically
  inside some function body.
  
  A function is tail recursive if all of its recursive calls are tail calls.
  
  let sumList l = 
    let rec helper sum l =
    match l with
    [] -> sum
    | h::t -> helper (h+sum) t
    in helper 0 l
```

###Scripting Languages
1. hallmarks:
  1. easy manipulation of text data (regular expression)
  2. easy interaction with the system (files, processes, etc.)
  3. convenient syntax for lots of common operations
2. disadvantages:
  1. dynamically typed
  2. kitchen sink approach
    1. functional core
    2. objects
    3. imperative feature

Python assignment constructs an alias instead of a copy

```python
def prodList(l):
  result = i
  for i in l:
    result *= i
  return result
  
f = (lambda x: x+1)
map(f,[1,2,3,4,5])

l = [[1,2],[3,4],[5]]
l2 = map(lambda lst: lst.reverse(), l)

l = [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]
for (x,y) in l:
  print (x+y)
  
reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [1,2,3,4,5])

l = [1,2,3,4,5]
[x+1 for x in l]

map(lambda x:x+1, filter(lambda x: x>3, l))
[x+1 for x in l if x>3]

l1 = [1,2,3]
l2 = [4,5,6]
[(x,y) for x in l1 for y in l2]

r = {"name":"myrect", "width":3,1, "height":2.4}
r["name"]
r["name"] =  "todd"
r["color"] = "green"

#given a list of ints, make a dictionary mapping each element to its frequency
def frequency(l):
  d = {}
  for i in l:
    if i in d:
      d[i]+= 1;
    else:
      d[i] = 1
  return d
```
## Object Oriented Programming (In Java)
three key concepts:  
1. subtyping
2. inheritance
3. dynamic dispatch

key idea:  
everything is an object and objects only communicate by sending messages
  
separation of interface and implementation

```java
// SEAS machiens: /usr/local/cs/bin/{java,javac}
// a type for set of strings
interface Set {
  boolean contains(String s);
  void add(String s);
}

// an implementation of the Set type
class ListSet implements Set {
  protected List<String> elems = 
  new LinkedList<String>();
  public boolean contains(String s) {
    return elems.contains(s);
  }
  
  public void add(String s) {
    if(this.contains(s))
      return;
    else
      elems.add(s);
  }
}
class Client {
  void m(Set s) {
    if(s.contains("hi"))
      s.add("bye");
      }
}

/*subtyping polymorphism in some sense keeps the power of parametric polymorphism while having some constraints (being a subtype of a type). Thus ensures safe interaction between interfaces */

/* Inheritance 
  a mechanism for code reuse in implementations (it is not necessary, it is just an implementation property while subtyping polymorphism is an interface property */

// You can only "extends" one class but "implements" can implements infinitely many classes
```
##Monday May 9th
```java
// parametric: type vairables

interface List<T> {
  void add(T t);
  boolean contains(T t);
}

// subtyping:
two methods:
1. implement
2. extend
interface C {
  // ...
}

interface D extends C {
  //...
}

// why do we need parametric polymorphism?

// what is the difference between ObjectList and List<T> above?
/*
  1. objectlist can contain any kind of object
    - a single list can contain strings, intgers, etc. but List<String> can only contain Strings
  2. parametric polymorphism can correlate input and output types. Subtying can't.
  
  
*/

// bounded parametric polymorphism
class AnimalList<T extends Animal>

// static overloading

/*key point: if two methods have the same name but either different number of args or different parameters type, then they are treated as if they have different names.

two phases of method lookup:

static phase: based on the static types of the parameters, we find the right "method family"
  - method name plus argument types

dynamic phase: dynamic dispatch on the receiver object, over the methods from the statically chosen method family
*/

/* OO style" each object knows how to do certain things, specified by some kind of interface.

clients should be able to manipulate the object just through that interface.
*/


```
##Wednesday May 11th
###Exception in Java
The downside of Exception:  
It won't be forced to be dealt with and can be easily ignored by other programmers, thus increasing the risk of runtime crashes.
```java
/* 
two ways to deal with exceptions:
1. put exceptions in function signatures
2. use try catch

It is okay for a function to throw less exceptions than its signature declares

Type-checker links exceptions with type signature at compile time
*/

/*
exception safety:

*/
```
###Memory Layout in Java
Objects are always on the heap (its pointer(variable, reference to the object) is on the stack), not the stack. It is the garbage collector's job to decide if part of the heap can be cleaned.

Assign an variable to another object is aliasing.

####Parameter Passing
In Java, parameter passing is by value:  
the value of the actual parameter is copied into the formal parameter. But the values are always pointers.  
key property: the value of the actual parameter cannot be changed by the function call

##Monday May 16th
###Parallel Computing
1. We can no longer use Moore's Law to speed up sequential programming. Now we are using Moore's Law to double the number of processors roughly eveny two years.
2. Big Data. With lots of data, we're now programming across clusters of machines or data centers.
```java
class Sum {
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    int size = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    int[] arr = new arr[size];
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++)
      arr[i] = i;
  }
}

// fork-join model
```
