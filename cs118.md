##Question
1. In the initial setup of SMTP connection, does the greeting phase acheive with the very initial TCP connection 
or it is after the initial TCP connection. Or putting this question in another way, how do we interpret the receiver SMTP 
process's first connection `220 zimbra.cs.ucla.edu ESMTP` slides on Lecture 4 page 20.
2. The transport of email on the lecture slides Lecture 4 page 26.
3. Lecture 4 page 34, what's the meaning of `HTTP:pull` and `SMTP:push`?  
`pull` means that the receiver will decide if he want to receive data. However, for `push`, the receiver must receive the data.

##Question

##Question
On lecture 8 slide 16, the graph of closing a TCP connection seems to be wrong because there should be more FIN-ACKs.

On lecture 15 slide 41, how to configure a router exactly?
  
On lecture 15, slide 16, why IP address is not flat?

On lecture 15, slide 33, how to understand this graph?

On lecture 15, slide 38, why in both cases, only B2 is flooded?

##Layers

* Layer 2: link layer
* Layer 3: network layer
* Layer 4: transport layer

IP packet's identifier is set at the creation of the IP packet.

How to get on Internet:
Your IP, (gateway IP), IP of caching resolver, netmask (to create a routing entry). Use DHCP to get an IP address in the network.
